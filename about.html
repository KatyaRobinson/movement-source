                        <p>Kelly Adorno is from the Delaware County area and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Dance from Temple University with a minor in Business Management.  Since completing Body Precision Inc.â€™s comprehensive Teacher Program, Ms. Adorno has been continuing her education through workshops, reading professional articles and
                        online seminars.</p>
                        
                        <p>Growing up as a dancer, Pilates has complimented Kelly's training in a way that no other movement form could.  In between teaching her clients, Kelly can be found at the local coffee shop, shopping for fitness clothes, or attending a Pilates workshop.  Constant curiosity keeps her striving for new approaches to traditional exercises in order to mold each session for the individual.   Kelly's teaching technique combines moving, learning, sweating, and laughing. She is fascinated with the amount of healing the Pilates system can provide and loves sharing her experiences and making new discoveries with her clients.</p>

She is passionate about her profession and it shows in her desire to learn more about her clients, her profession and me personally.  She asks me how I feel, how I'm doing since our last session,  how was my weekend and what do I want to work on today.  Kelly is a true gift in my life."
